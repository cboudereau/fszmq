description
    fszmq is an MPLv2-licensed F# binding for the ZeroMQ  distributed computing library.
    This library is primarily designed to be consumed from F#. 
    However, where possible, the library has been designed to appear "friendly" when consumed by other .NET languages (C#, et aliam).
    NOTE: This package **ONLY** provides the managed `fszmq.dll` file. **You** need to provide the appropriate native `libzmq` file.
